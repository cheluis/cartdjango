Application to shop publications. It has some designs flaws (publication and its files should be normalized),
and some architecturals errors too that I plan to fix. Also, gonna try to push to some PaaS service.

The verification email wasn't implemented due problems with the authentication system. Given the time I 
decided not to implement it. 

I didn't used any frontend framework, just a little bit of jquery, It wasn't necessary in my opinion.
