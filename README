Application to shop publications. It has some designs flaws (publication and its files should be normalized),
and some architecturals errors too that I plan to fix. Also, gonna try to push to some PaaS service.

Steps to run locally:

1.- clone
2.- virtualenv venv
3.- source venv/bin/activate
4.- pip install -r > requirements.txt
5.- export DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:@host:port/database (must be created)
6.- manage.py syncdb
7.- manage.py migrate
8.- manage.py loaddata fixture.json
